    <p class="next">Pizza is one of the most loved foods around the world. It is made with a flat round base of dough topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and a variety of ingredients like vegetables, meat, or herbs. The best thing about pizza is that it can be customized according to personal tasteâ€”some people prefer a simple Margherita with just cheese and basil, while others enjoy loaded toppings like pepperoni, mushrooms, or extra cheese. Whether baked in a traditional wood-fired oven or ordered from a fast-food outlet, pizza always brings joy to gatherings, parties, and family dinners. It is not just food, but a comfort and a celebration on a plate.</p>
